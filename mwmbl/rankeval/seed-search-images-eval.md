# Images in Seed Search: evaluation

## Query gate and image ranking

This section asks two questions for #610. Can Jev tell which queries want images? And once a query does, which
Commons images should it show? Everything is measured on the 849 train queries against Sonnet reference labels.
The code is `mwmbl/rankeval/seed_images/` (`run_relevance`, `label_batches`, `labels`, `gate_analysis`), and the
data is under `devdata/seed_images/gate/`.

### Setup

- **Candidates:** each query's top 20 Commons results, without the images whose Jev NSFW score is 1.0 or more
  (the threshold from the #610 benchmark). This keeps 15,846 of 16,512 images.
- **Jev questions, in separate mode:**
  - image need, asked once per query with its web top ten's titles;
  - image relevance, one request per query covering all its candidates (946 queries, 16.8 images per request
    on average). Relevance latency was 0.34 s at p50, 0.47 s at p90, 0.56 s at p95 and 0.99 s at worst.
- **Reference labels** came from Sonnet judges, with rubrics written separately from the Jev questions:
  - **Need (0–3):** would a strip of three to five Commons pictures improve this page for a UK searcher? The
    judge saw the web top ten and the titles of the top five candidates. All 849 queries were labelled; 200
    (23.6%) scored 2 or more.
  - **Relevance (0–3):** the judge read each image's file name, description (first 400 characters) and
    categories, plus the query's first three web titles. It labelled the top 12 candidates of 150 queries,
    sampled equally from the five quintiles of Jev need. Only queries with at least 3 candidates were eligible.
    That makes 1,689 images.
  - **Vision spot-check:** 100 of those images, chosen only from ones every local safety layer passed (rules,
    NudeNet and SigLIP2). The judge labelled them again, this time seeing the 320px thumbnail as well as the
    text. The thumbnails were deleted afterwards.
- **Label checks:** every id was labelled exactly once. 718 of the 849 need reasons are distinct. 40 of the 150
  sampled queries have all 12 images at 0, and spot checks show these are genuine. For example, the Commons
  results for "cardiff" are pictures of Quebec, and "alcaraz" returns the Spanish town, not the tennis player.

### Gate

The table scores each signal against a reference need of 2 or more. For thresholded signals, the precision and
recall are out of fold: each of 5 folds picks its F1-best threshold on the other four.

| Gate | AUC | Gated in | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Always | 0.500 | 100.0% | 0.236 | 1.000 |
| Never | 0.500 | 0.0% | – | 0.000 |
| **Jev need** | **0.890** | 25.6% | **0.636** | 0.690 |
| Jev-safe candidate count | 0.644 | 73.4% | 0.283 | 0.880 |
| Pass-1 intent entity/local | 0.699 | 41.1% | 0.410 | 0.715 |

- **Threshold:** fitted on all train queries, the threshold is Jev need ≥ **1.63**. It gates in 28% of train
  queries and 27% of en-gb queries, with precision 0.62 and recall 0.75 in sample.
- **False positives** are mostly shopping queries, such as "barcelona kit 25/26", "walnut sideboard" and
  "holiday dresses". Jev wants pictures for these, but the rubric says Commons has little for products.
- **False negatives** are mostly places asked about in a transactional way, such as "windsor castle tickets",
  "stansted express" and "maps liverpool", plus bare city names like "liverpool" and "newcastle".

### Image ranking

NDCG@k uses gain 2^label − 1, computed over each sampled query's 12 labelled candidates. The 40 queries whose
labels are all 0 have no ideal ordering and are left out, so the means are over the other 110.

| Order | NDCG@1 | NDCG@3 | NDCG@5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jev relevance** | **0.871** | **0.885** | **0.901** |
| Commons rank | 0.614 | 0.648 | 0.676 |
| Mix, Jev − w·(Commons rank − 1), 5-fold CV | 0.860 | 0.874 | 0.893 |

- **Mix:** the folds chose w = 0, 0, 0, 0.02 and 0.05. Commons' order adds nothing on top of Jev.
- **Caveat:** this ranks only the labelled top 12. In production Jev would rank all the candidates.

The table below compares the text labels and Jev with the vision labels, on 100 images. Jev's score is rounded
for the exact and ±1 columns.

| Against vision | Spearman | Exact | ±1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text label | 0.897 | 77% | 99% |
| Jev relevance | 0.842 | 57% | 98% |

The text labels track what the pictures show closely. The reference therefore holds without vision, and so does
Jev's text-only relevance. Two caveats: the vision judge saw the same text as well as the picture, so the two
labels are not independent, and the 100 images all passed every local safety layer, so they are not a random
draw from the candidates.

### Number of images and minimum relevance

The table covers the 41 sampled queries that the recommended gate (Jev need ≥ 1.63) lets in. The pool is each
query's top k by Jev relevance, keeping only images at or above the minimum. "Good" and "Wrong" are shares of the
images shown.

| k | Min Jev relevance | Images per query | Queries with any | Good (≥2) | Wrong (0) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 0.0 | 3.98 | 100% | 66.9% | 14.1% |
| 4 | 1.0 | 3.22 | 88% | 80.3% | 2.3% |
| **4** | **1.5** | **2.83** | **80%** | **87.1%** | **0.9%** |
| 4 | 2.0 | 2.46 | 73% | 90.1% | 1.0% |
| 4 | 2.5 | 1.88 | 61% | 94.8% | 0.0% |

- **Other values of k:** at k = 3 and k = 6, the good share is within a point of k = 4 at each minimum of 1.0
  or more. With no minimum, k = 6 shows more wrong images (17.5% against 14.1%).
- **In sample:** k, the minimum and the gate threshold were all chosen on these same queries, so these shares
  are optimistic. They rest on 41 queries and about 116 images, so each is good to several points.
- **Reference-wanted queries:** on the 34 sampled queries whose reference need is 2 or more, k = 4 with a
  minimum of 1.5 shows 3.26 images. 88% of them are good and 0.9% are wrong.

### Recommendation

- **Gate:** show images when Jev image need ≥ **1.63**. That is about 27% of queries, and AUC is 0.89 against
  0.70 for the best non-Jev baseline.
- **Order:** sort by Jev image relevance alone, ignoring Commons' order.
- **Number:** show up to **4** images.
- **Minimum:** require Jev image relevance ≥ **1.5**. A fifth of gated-in queries then show no images, which
  is better than showing wrong ones.

These settings are in `devdata/seed_images/gate/recommended.json` for the holistic comparison.

## Holistic comparison

The deciding step compares whole result pages with the holistic judge (`holistic_judge.py`), on the 295 en-gb
queries, which none of the settings above were tuned on. `mwmbl/rankeval/seed_images/holistic_arms.py` builds the
arms and their batches under `devdata/seed_images/holistic/`.

- **A0:** production's order, Jev composite + Staan rank.
- **A2, the recommended design:** when Jev need ≥ 1.63, a strip of up to 4 Jev-safe images with Jev relevance
  ≥ 1.5, highest first, is one extra entry after the top web result. It displaces no web result. 80 queries are
  gated in and 59 get a strip, of 213 images in all.
- **A1, no gate:** the two most relevant Jev-safe images join the web results as single results, merged by Jev
  composite, and the list is cut back to ten. An image scores as a substantive page Staan didn't return, so its
  composite is its Jev relevance − 0.5. This puts 191 images into 118 queries' top tens, mostly at positions 7
  to 10.

The judge sees a strip as `[IMAGES from Wikimedia Commons] 1. <file name> — <description> | 2. …` and a single
image as `[IMAGE] <file name> — <description>`, with descriptions cut to 150 characters. Batches that show images
add a paragraph telling the judge that pictures may appear and to judge whether they help the query; the rest of
the rubric is unchanged. A vision check repeats 20 of the A2-vs-A0 comparisons with the strips' thumbnails, using
only strips whose every image passed the rules, NudeNet and SigLIP2 (26 of the 59 did). The thumbnails were
deleted after judging.

### Results

Haiku 4.5 judged each comparison in both orders. Only queries whose lists differ are compared. Preference runs
from −3 to 3, and a positive value favours the image arm.

| Comparison | Queries | Preference [95% CI] | Images / A0 / tie | Orders agree |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A2 vs A0** | 59 | **+0.84 [+0.64, +1.01]** | 85% / 8% / 7% | 93% |
| A1 vs A0 | 118 | +0.12 [−0.03, +0.29] | 47% / 38% / 15% | 73% |
| A2 vs A0, strip passed every local layer | 26 | +0.85 [+0.63, +1.02] | 85% / 4% / 12% | 88% |
| A2 vs A0, strip flagged by a local layer | 33 | +0.83 [+0.52, +1.11] | 85% / 12% / 3% | 97% |
| A2 vs A0, vision subset, text only | 20 | +0.82 [+0.57, +1.02] | 85% / 5% / 10% | 90% |
| A2 vs A0, vision subset, with thumbnails | 20 | +1.27 [+0.93, +1.57] | 90% / 5% / 5% | 85% |

- **A2** wins clearly. Most verdicts are "slight", with 13 of 118 "clear", and the main reasons are relevance (83)
  and coverage (21). A0 wins on 5 queries, all where the strip shows the wrong sense of the query. Examples are
  other people with the same name ("boone helm", "tom wagner", "isak") and the palace for "versailles series".
  This is the same homonym failure the relevance labels showed.
- **A1** is not significantly better than A0, and judges disagree more often (73% order agreement). It has no
  gate and no minimum relevance, so its images often land in the last few places as off-topic pictures (off-topic
  flags: 105 against A0's 72). A0 wins 45 of the 118 queries, for example "chargeback" and "willis pharmacy".
  Where A1 wins, it is mostly because the image replaced a weak tenth result.
- **Local safety layers:** strips the local layers flagged score the same as those they passed. The local layers
  don't pick out worse strips, so they matter for safety only.
- **Vision:** with thumbnails, the judges favour A2 more strongly (+1.27 against +0.82 from text alone on the
  same 20 queries). The two agree in direction on 19 of the 20 queries. The text-only judgment therefore
  understates A2 a little, if anything.
- **Caveat:** A2 adds an entry without removing one, so a judge may partly reward more content. The losses on
  wrong-sense strips show the judges do penalise bad pictures.

### Recommendation

Ship option 2, the gated strip:

- **Gate:** show a strip only when Jev image need is at least 1.63, which is about 27% of queries.
- **Images:** take the Jev-safe images (Jev NSFW below 1.0) with Jev image relevance of at least 1.5. Sort them
  by Jev relevance alone and show at most 4.
- **Placement:** put the strip after the top web result, as one extra entry that displaces no web result.

Don't merge single images into the web ranking (option 1): judged holistically it is no better than today's
results. Wrong-sense images are the main remaining failure, so the next lever is the minimum relevance or a
check that the image's subject matches the top web result's.
